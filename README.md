### What this does

Converts Internet Explorer Favorites bookmarks from .url files to a .htm file that can be imported into Safari.

### Usage

Run `fav2safari.sh` and supply a path, e.g. -

`./fav2safari.sh ~/Documents/Favorites`

If a path is not supplied, the script will look for a Favorites folder on the Desktop.

The script will output a Bookmarks.htm file to the Desktop that can be imported into Safari.
